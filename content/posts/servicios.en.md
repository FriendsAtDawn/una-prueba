**Digital Forensics and Trust Services**

Professional **expert witness services in computer science and IT**, with advanced specialization in **digital evidence analysis**, **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**, **advanced electronic signature systems**, and the full range of **Trust Services** governed by regulations such as eIDAS (Regulation (EU) No 910/2014) and complementary national legislation.

My expert witness work is designed to deliver **objective, rigorous technical clarity** in judicial proceedings (civil, criminal, commercial, labor, or administrative) where cryptographic technologies play a key role, including qualified digital certificates, timestamps, strong authentication systems (including biometrics and multi-factor), certified electronic communications, log records, IP addresses, metadata, storage devices, cloud environments, and networks in general.

### Key Areas of Expertise

- Verification of **authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation** of electronically signed documents (simple, advanced, and qualified electronic signatures).

- Forensic analysis of **digital evidence** from computers, mobile phones, tablets, servers, hard drives, USB drives, memory cards, messaging systems (WhatsApp, email, Telegram, Signal, etc.), social networks, and collaborative platforms.

- Determination of the **true creation, modification, or sending date and time** of files and messages through metadata analysis and reliable trusted timestamps.

- Investigation of **security incidents** with judicial relevance: unauthorized access, intrusions, malware, phishing, digital identity theft, leakage or theft of confidential information, tampering with electronic evidence.

- Chronological and technical reconstruction of **digital events** (who did what, when, from where, and using what means).

- Audit and expert assessment of **enterprise or public administration PKI systems**: certificate validity, revocation, trust hierarchies, standards compliance.

- Evaluation of the **chain of custody** for digital evidence from collection to court presentation (SHA-2/SHA-3 hashing, bit-for-bit forensic imaging, write-blocking, chronological documentation).

- Preparation of **detailed expert reports**, suitable for ratification in court, using technical language accessible to legal professionals with well-founded conclusions.

- Counter-expertise and critical review of third-party expert reports.

- Technical advisory support before or during proceedings to attorneys and legal representatives on strategies involving digital evidence.

All procedures adhere to internationally accepted standards in **digital forensics** (ISO/IEC 27037, 27042, NIST SP 800-86, UNE guidelines, chain-of-custody best practices) to ensure that evidence is **admissible, authentic, complete, reliable, and credible** before any court.
