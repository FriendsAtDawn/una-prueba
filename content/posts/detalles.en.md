  In-depth examination of electronic documents, emails, contracts, invoices, chats, attachments, and any relevant digital media.

  Specialized support to attorneys, solicitors, and legal practices throughout all stages of the process: from initial assessment of available digital evidence, design of strategies for evidence collection and preservation, preparation of procedural documents (requests for expert evidence, challenges, etc.), to technical accompaniment in preparatory meetings, interrogations, or hearings. Confidential and strategic advice to maximize the probative impact of electronic evidence.
